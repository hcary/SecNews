**Executive Summary**

The prevailing themes across cybersecurity news sources today point to a concerning increase in sophisticated ransomware attacks, emphasizing vulnerabilities in identity and access management (IAM) systems and supply chain risks. Several articles highlight how attackers are leveraging stolen credentials, exploiting misconfigured systems, and targeting critical infrastructure to maximize their impact. The move towards more targeted attacks, often preceded by extensive reconnaissance and lateral movement within networks, necessitates a robust and proactive GRC approach that includes comprehensive risk assessments, stringent security controls around IAM, supply chain due diligence, and proactive threat hunting capabilities. The rise of AI-powered attacks is also a growing concern, making detection and response even more challenging.
